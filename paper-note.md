# Paper note
> The students in the SDN/NFV class need to read and report a paper assigned by the teacher, here is the note about papers.

To start with, I will take note for my assignment, [Ananta: Cloud Scale Load Balancing](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs589/papers/ananta.pdf), according to [How to Read a Paper](http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~ray/teaching/CA485/notes/01_how_to_read_a_paper.pdf).
